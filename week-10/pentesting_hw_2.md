## HW7 - Pentesting 2 (SuperSecureBank)

### Part 1 - The Vulnerabilities
There are a number of vulnerabilities in the application including XSS, CSRF, SQLi, business logic, information disclosure, and others. Your job as the penetration tester is to find and document as many of these as you can. There may be more than I originally intended so I will just say that you should be able to find roughly 10 "issues" of varying levels of severity for full credit, with half of those beign high severity issues like XSS, SQLi, or serious business logic vulnerabilities. When reporting give priority to higher severity issues. If you submit 10 low level issues then you will not receive full credit.

Notes on how to count issues: 

- If you find multiple occurances of XSS or SQLi each of those is a seperate "issue" to be documented
- If you find multiple occurances of CSRF then group those all into one issue report and simply list the forms vulnerable to CSRF

### Part 2 - The Report
For every issue you find you will need to fill out this Google Form: http://goo.gl/forms/yKQ1qVw1zfYJkeZB2

The information requested on the form is similar to what has been requested on previous homeworks and I expect the same level of depth in your answers.

I would recommend saving all of your issue writeups in a txt file or spreadsheet, then filling out the form to submit them last all at once. You are able to go back and edit previous form submissions, but you have to save the link to that form when you submit it.

### Due Date
This will all be due Friday June 3rd at 3:30pm PST

### Note
No automated tools!!

Be careful not to corrupt your database, if you do I will have to wipe it back to the original state.

Don't mess with eachother's sites!

If you have questions please feel free to email myself or the TA.
